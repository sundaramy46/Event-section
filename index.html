                    <p1> Hack4Cause is organised by IEEE-SSIT every year and this year we organized it for second time. It makes for one of many success stories of chapters at VIT. Held on the 10th and 11th of March, the 24-hour event housed over 900 participants, making it VIT's most popular and successful Hackathon! It covered 4 major tracks namely - Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography and Internet of Things, and witnessed some great projects within a stressful time-limit, virtuously claiming prizes worth â‚¹30,000. The event had real life problem statements in regards to what effects the society and was overseen by the panel of judges who kindly volunteered to help from the SCOPE school.</p1>

                    <h1><b></b><u>OPEN SOURCE PROGRAMMING AND WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></b></h1>
                    <p1>Open source technology is the production and development philosophy of allowing end users and developers to not only see the source code of the software, but modify it as well. Any type of software program can be open source, including operating systems, databases, applications, games and even programming languages. In our workshop we taught them the concepts of Open Source programming and the basic GitHub commands and its complete uses, and to make open-source contributions. Along with this, we also taught them cloud computing which is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management of the user. Our main focus for this workshop was on Amazon Web Services Console, we taught them various technology being used in web development with the main focus on JavaScript.</p1>
